## Nomenclature
- IRL: “In the Real World”, where we live our daily lives in our physical bodies.
- IRLJ: “IRL Job”: a real world job, can be fulfilled from the metaverse as well. 
- RP: “Role Playing”, a player impersonates his / her selected character based on the lore of the game they play. 
- NPC: “Non-playing Character”. A character in the game, which is controlled by an AI and not by a real human player.
- [Anime - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime)
- Subverse: a subverse is a virtual world that impersonates a look and feel of a certain virtual world. Players in a subverse can build up an alternate life, live and work in the subverse just as they would from IRL. Currently the term "metaverse" is used wrongly by many projects, as people building submerses in reality, and the collection of these submerses will be the metaverse itself.

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

Our application is both about a subverse and a game project, taking place in Nova Budapest, which is a future cyberpunk imaginary megacity in Europe, after an imaginary nuclear war. 

_By subverse we mean an immersive experience, where people can log in to play, or just do their daily job in a digital flat in the city, which can be obtained by real players, and used in VR as a landing / working area._

### Project Details

#### Economy and world

The ultimate goal is players to be able to live in a fully self-sustained economy inside the subverse. In a classic in-game economy like World of Warcraft and Cyberpunk 2077 the NPC’s are giving out quests and issues payments for the players. The idea here is that people should interact with each other and create supply and demand based on their ingame needs. You can also sell your items that you acquired in game to merchants.

A few NPC’s should exist to create some low-level basic income, but that should be too low for people to do anything impactful or buy anything above basic. Example: the basic income is 100 coins a month, you can buy a subway monthly ticket for 20 and pay your rent for 80, and go to various places in the city to pick up work from other players. Or, if you already have a vehicle, you can fill in the gasoline tank (in case of a combustion engine).

There are also merchant shops - some controlled by real players -, where the players playing as creators can put up their in-game goods for sale. You can buy these items, the merchant takes a cut from the selling, hence putting back the tokens to circulation if the seller was a player, or burning the spent tokens if the seller was an NPC.
The monetary system

For buying items and paying for services, players need to use the world’s cryptocurrency. The name of this currency is ForDit, which is an alias for the Forint and Credit words. 

The governorate is issuing 100.000 ForDit after every NFT which represents a person. This means that if the metaverse will have 10.000 NFT players and 10.000 non-NFT players, the total amount of ForDit in circulation is 2 billion.

#### The governance system

The city-state needs to have a governorate. This council would have 10 members. 6 would be fulfilled from the founders of the subverse, and 3 would be elected officials by the population. 1 member is the council leader. These all are playing characters who are responsible for running the city-state. 

#### State Incomes
The state can receive incomes from:
- Taxes. Mostly from merchants and citizens.
- Issuing more currency (we need to do inflation-prevention here with various methods).
- Rent payments from civilians who are not able to afford their own housing.
- Allocation of goods from criminals.

#### State payments
- Paying cops and military servicemen.
- Paying government officials (limited, we need to avoid any option for a council member taking out too much in income).
- Spending money on basic community services, renovations, and building new buildings in the city.
- Spending money on any governance activities which can be tied to the welfare of the city.

#### Challenges, questions
- How to create supply and demand for people to log in and fulfil roles and play? This needs to somehow mimic the real world issues of people, because we act based on those in our real life. This is why we wake up every day and go to work.
- Taxation. Should there be a central taxation system? Will the governorate of the game be able to expand the city based on the taxation income? How should we tax the citizens? What should be done with the tax avoiders?
- How basic the start should be for a player? Should you start with your pre-purchased NFT goods and characters, and an empty flat / place in the slums? 
- What happens if for example a merchant with a bike repair shop is offline? Should an AI take over, but with a penalty on the accepted jobs? Like if the IRL player starts the repair job, it takes 3 hours, but if the AI starts the job, it is 4 hours?

We need to be able to create all options, roles and professions for people to fill the subverse with life. 

#### Supported lifestyles
The foundations are to play and have fun, and to earn in the meantime. Players can earn in-game currency with their activities / professions / in-game jobs. The ultimate goal is that people will be able to join the subverse for doing their daily jobs and earn enough coins to support their IRL living expenses. These activities / professions / in-game jobs should be supported by a game engine which is scalable enough if the project starts to grow. 

Recommended a “Do not disturb switch”, for people who want to join the subverse for doing IRL-related work, but in the subverse environment. Example: a programmer really enjoys the Nova-Budapest look and feel, and wants to code in a VR experience, but would like to exclude the possibility of getting raided by a bunch of thugs. If the programmer sets the “Do not disturb switch” before joining the subverse, his / her apartment or office room can not be entered by anyone except direct invitees. 

#### IRL Lifestyles (examples)
Since our goal is an alternate world where you can earn coins even to support your IRL life, a player should be able to do anything he can in IRL. For example all possible IT jobs can be ported to the subverse.
Participants in education. Does it matter where you attend your remote class? Why can’t you attend it from a VR subverse, and after school you go with your classmates and do some mercenary work? Maybe the principal won’t notice.
Programmer. Does it matter if you code from inside a VR game, or in front of your computer? Code is code.
Project manager. Does it matter if you click and fill Jira in a VR game if the outcome is the same?

#### Role Player Lifestyles
What if you have a daily job, which you like and / or you need to be present in person, but in the evenings you want to be someone else?
- Bartender: However your bar is virtual, you can still role play a bartender, collect information, resell them, and have a discussion with people.
- Mechanic: You would love to repair broken engines, cars, motorbikes? Here you can do it. Since players will be able to purchase / get vehicles, but won’t be able to repair them, they need to bring those into a mechanic. 
- Mercenary. You can’t kill people IRL, but in a subverse you can. Why not direct violence to a place, where it can not cause real harm?
- Shopkeeper. What if I have a fashion idea, and I want to open a clothing store? I need to apply at the city governorate for a license, and after that I can open my shop in the city. 
- Military serviceman. As a member of the military your role is to help in securing the order in the city. You receive state payment. Number of the military is limited based on the number of the player population.
- Member of the UBRE. You can RP a cop, and during your employment, you receive payment from the state. Number of the police is limited based on the number of the player population.

#### Art
The art style should be addictive, anime style cyberpunk and represent mostly Asian-style culture with European perks. This is in correlation with the story of Nova-Budapest, as a lot of asian influx happened in the last weeks of the shield creation.

#### Technology platform
The subverse should be cross-platform. Target platforms are:
- XR
- PC with flat client
- OSX with flat client

#### Engine
Unreal product line.

#### Optional team setup
- Artist 1: draws character art
- Artist 2: draws character art
- Dev 1: website development, infra + devops 
- Dev 2: smart contract creator
- Dev 3: marketplace (Opensea, etc.) developer + minting code developer 
- Writer / proofreader
- Webdesigner

### Ecosystem Fit

We think as more and more game companies are experimenting with blockchain additions to their projects, or even introducing tokes as in-game currency, we can declare, that a computer game is definitely a fit to a blockchain ecosystem.

As mentioned above, we target both IRL lifestyle subvese inhabitants, RP-ers and classic players. We are convinced, that our project art and direction will resonate with the "classic" and "neo-classic" anime and MMORPG lovers, and they will find this ever changing world immersive enough to play.

We have no knowledge of a project with this details and uniqueness (nor, a game project as a matter of fact) in the Polkadot ecosystem. We know only one project called [Big Time](https://bigtime.gg/) in the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Development Status :open_book:

Ongoing. We already submitted the relevant repositories and ready to present the art. No 3D art is ready at the moment.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Laying Down the Foundations (Done)

### Creating key and character arts (60% readiness)
In this step the key arts for the characters will be created as listed in this paragraph. These arts cannot be cheap, and should reflect the highest quality available.

Key arts are one of the main pillars of a successful fundraising as these characters will be minted into NFT’s, and will be the 3D characters in the game. 

### Establishing basic infrastructure (20% readiness)
In this phase the developers create the project website, decide on the blockchain and NFT technology. We train an AI assistant with the game lore to help newcomers. After they set up the smart contract and the minting and web accounts.

### Pre-development
The game won’t be able to penetrate to wide audience without any basic gameplay. This needs to be created with 2-3 characters modeled and animated, and some environment pre-modelled, even 4-5 quests playable. Optimally vehicles and VR e-learning demo. Optimal length is 45 seconds of gameplay video.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 8 months

- **Total Costs:** ??? EUR

### Milestone 1 — Getting website up and running

- **Estimated duration:** 2 month
- **FTE:**  3
- **Costs:** 24,500 USD

The website would contain not only an AI assistant and basic information about the game and the lore, but a complex quest system, where users can play through the website. Completing a certain questline will put the player into a caste, which determines his / her NFT.

| 1a. | Environment modelling | We aim to show a different player of Nova Budapest in the VR home than we show in the playable demo. |
| 1b. | Environment setup | A VR space needs to be set up slightly differently than a PC TPS shooter environment. This is why we need to create a few more 3D models of  extra buildings and assets. |
| 2. | Hand gesture handling | We aim to use Meta Quest's hand tracking system in the use of gear, and interaction, so the players can have a proper experience. |
| 3. | VR Home | We aim to create a downloadable VR Home which can function as a hub for the logged in player. A great example is [Valve's Half Life Alyx VR Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtpUSbEjl50). |

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to finance the project's long-term maintenance and development,
- how you intend to use, enhance, and promote your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

Originally we aimed to raise funds to pre-development from a paid NFT mint and trade royalties, but we came to the conclusion that the current NFT meta changed in terms of trust from the 2021 NFT meta, as people in the crypto space realised, that there were too much scam projects and empty promises. 

Due to this realization we started to burn our own wealth with the goal of creating as much content as possible, but this process is slow, and dependent on our daily jobs. 

We are hopeful, that a successful demo can attract partnerships to fund the project to a certain level. 

We aim to Twitter (X) as the main marketing platform. We have a solid marketing and content plan for 180 days long. Available to present in private.

Long term project income can be from taxation the citizens activities as explained before. We do not aim to introduce a monthly fee, however we aim to introduce the a buying price for the initial game, as based on our experience it holds back scammers. Initial price won't be applicable for the alpha and beta users, as they will get their NFT's fro free.

The team is not intended to sell the IP or exit in any way.
